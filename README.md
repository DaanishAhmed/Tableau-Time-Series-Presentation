Time Series Analysis on Countries Through Time
----------------

This presentation was made using Tableau software, and it involves analyzing the Gross Domestic Product (GDP), life expectancy, and child mortality rate of five countries between 1960 and 2015.  The data was collected from the United Nations for the following countries: the United States, China, Sweden, the Philippines, and Afghanistan.  The goal is to determine the existence and strength of any relationship between GDP and life expectancy or mortality rate.  Additionally, I used time series analysis to predict each country's life expectancy, mortality rate, and GDP up to the year 2020 and studied whether those predictions were reliable.

A summary of my presentation is included as a .pdf file.  This summary highlights the subject, motivation, and findings of my analysis.  The PowerPoint presentation used in my video can be found in the file "Countries Through Time.pptx".

The data files used in this project were all obtained from the United Nations Data Retrieval System.  I downloaded the data sheets containing GDP, life expectancy, and child mortality rate for all five countries between 1960 and 2015.  I then combined the data into a single spreadsheet named "UN Data 1960-2015.xlsx".

The video was created using a free trial of Camtasia 9.  My presentation is posted on YouTube, and the link is contained in the file "link to presentation.txt".  Alternatively, the link can be found below:

I have also included the Tableau file "UN Country Graphs.twb".  This file includes all of the visualizations used in my report.  It uses the data source "UN Data 1960-2015.xlsx".
